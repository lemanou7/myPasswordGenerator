# Password Generator

## Subject: Responsive Password Generator

## Description:
This repo is to create an application that will generate password using multiple parameters. When the prompt ask you: "How many characters would you like your password to be? ", you must entre a number between 8 and 128. 8 and 128 are included themselve. After that number input, you will be asked a series of question about whatever upper,numbers, special characters, lowercase characters you want in your password.When all answers are given, the application will go head and print the password on the screen. But if you don't like the generated password, you can still generate a new one without running the app again.
